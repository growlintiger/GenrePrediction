# GenrePrediction
My first ML Project which recommends genre on basis of age and gender.

This code uses Decision tree algorithm from the scikit learn library along with a sample dataset with manufactured data of age, gender and music preference to predict/recommend type of music to user.

Code was written in Jupyter notebook code editor in Python for Easier application.
